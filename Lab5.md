# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together
Ferrari Guan A17917695

## Introduction

<br />
The main topic of this lab is debugging. This includes using Bash scripts to autograde programming assignments and the Java Debugger (JDB). The Bash script moves files into a grading area and runs Junit tests. The JDB is used to debug a Java program in the command-line interface by stopping at specified points. At those stop points, a user can verify field and variable values, step-by-step analysis, and etc. 

## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

Anonymous Student:

I got this message when I put my code into the auto-grader. I ran ```bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-nested```, but it says that the file is not found, but I submitted my PA.

## Part 2 â€“ Reflection 

<br />
I found out that professors use bash scripts to test student submissions on GradeScope. I also found out that Java has a built-in debugger that can run through code line by line. I thought that this process could be much more thorough than trying to figure out why a test case failed. Lastly, through attending lab sections, I learned how to appear like a hacker to my humanities major friends.
