## Introduction

<br />
The main topic of this lab is debugging. This includes using Bash scripts to autograde programming assignments and the Java Debugger (JDB). The Bash script moves files into a grading area and runs Junit tests. The JDB is used to debug a Java program in the command-line interface by stopping at specified points. At those stop points, a user can verify field and variable values, step-by-step analysis, and etc.
