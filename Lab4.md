# Lab Report 4 - Vim (Week 7)
Ferrari Guan A17917695

## Introduction

<br />
Lab 4 introduced Vim, a text editor inside the terminal. Since Vim is built into the terminal, it does not have mouse support. However, it has a plethora of shortcuts and commands that can often make editing files faster. When the ```vim``` command is used in the terminal, a window opens up. In this window, text can be added and deleted. 
<br />

## Part 1: Editing from the command line: ```vim```

<br />
Task: <br />
Log into ```ieng6``` <br />
Clone your fork of the repository from your GitHub account (using the SSH URL) <br />
Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail <br />
Edit the code file to fix the failing test <br />
Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed <br />
Commit and push the resulting change to your GitHub account (you can pick any commit message!) <br />

<br />
![Log in to ieng6](https://b2bomber2.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/Photos/lab4-1.png)
<br />
Keys pressed: ```ssh <space> f1guan@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu <enter> cs15lwi24 <enter>``` <br />
Explanation: ```ssh``` enters the secure shell. Since the target server is ```ieng6```, the argument is ```f1guan@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu```. ```f1guan``` is my username, so it will differ depending on who logs into ```ieng6```.
