## Introduction

<br />
Lab 4 introduced Vim, a text editor inside the terminal. Since Vim is built into the terminal, it does not have mouse support. However, it has a plethora of shortcuts and commands that can often make editing files faster. When the ```vim``` command is used in the terminal, a window opens up. In this window, text can be added and deleted.
