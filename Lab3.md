Ferrari Guan A17917695

## Introduction

<br />
Lab 3 encompassed testing and debugging; command line manipulation, especially for finding files; and Bash scripting. The commands ```find```, ```less```, and ```grep``` were introduced during the lab session. 
<br />

## Part 1: Bugs
<br />

Provide:
A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

## Part 2: Researching Commands
<br />
For this section, I will choose to research the grep command.
